BiocBBSpack PackageSet instance.
 There are 1746 packages listed (Bioconductor version 3.10).
 There are 0 unique dependencies listed.
> system.time(populate_local_gits(ps3.10, "bioc_sources_3.10"))

That took 90 minutes to do 1746 package checkouts

stvjc@js-104-85:/vol_b$ du -sh bioc_sources_3.10
29G	bioc_sources_3.10

in the 90 minute interval, 2 packages were updated

> local_gits_behind_bioc("bioc_sources_3.10")
[1] "genphen" "scater" 

That seems wrong.  The version comparison needs to
improve.

to provision the builder's R with parallel installation,
we use it to install all packages; if it succeeds we
know we can make all tarballs

ps = BiocPkgTools::biocPkgList(version="3.10")
library(BiocBBSpack)
pp = PackageSet(ps$Package)
provision_r = function(pkgset, ncpu=6) {
	vec = pkgset@pkgnames
	BiocManager::install(vec, Ncpus=ncpu)
}
provision_r(pp)
	
after this first provisioning, future reprovisionings
should only occur via BiocManager::update

2h20m to install all packages to get to 3355 installed.

The R image grew to 78GB

The following code builds about 2 packages per minute

library(BiocBBSpack)
testpacks = dir("../bioc_sources_3.10", full.names=TRUE)
demo_run = parallel_tarballs(testpacks, dest="../bioc_tarballs_3.10",
			        ncores=7)
saveRDS(demo_run, file="demo_run.rda")

at 676 packages attempted the failure rate is about 6%

destiny failed because jupyter was not installed

-- a few packages failed to build for lack of infrastructure

libprotobuf-dev

 sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:opencpu/poppler
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo sudo apt-get install -y libpoppler-cpp-dev

Somehow these packages needed to be installed

install(c("pathological", "phateR", "protolite", "opencpu", 
"MafDb.gnomADex.r2.1.hs37d5", "pdftools", "MSGFplus"))

The last one has a problem with Java

--- AUGUST 6 ---

parallel_tarballs(allp, dest="../bioc_tarballs_3.10", ncores=20)
2.5 hours on xxlarge for 1511 packages.  need to understand what
a naive iteration will give with same number of cores

there were 235 packages attempted, 66 successes on a simple iteration

now reduce cores to 10

iterating gets us to 1634

some utilities:

redo.R:

library(BiocBBSpack)
done1 = basename(dir("../bioc_tarballs_3.10", full=TRUE))
done2 = basename(dir("../aug6_try2", full=TRUE))
done = c(done1, done2)
done = gsub("_.*" , "", done)
done[1:5]
allsrc = dir("../bioc_sources_3.10")
undone = setdiff(allsrc, done)
print(length(undone))
undone = paste0("../bioc_sources_3.10/", undone)
parallel_tarballs(undone, "../aug6_try2", ncores=10)
